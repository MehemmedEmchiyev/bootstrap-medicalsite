## Features

- **Fixed Navbar:** The navigation bar stays at the top of the page while scrolling.
- **Responsive Menu:** Includes a collapsible menu for smaller screen sizes, activated using Bootstrap's `navbar-toggler`.
- **Logo and Links:** Displays a clinic logo and links to different sections of the website.

### 2. **Hero Section**
- A visually appealing header section with a background image and introductory text.
- A call-to-action button, "Get started now," prominently displayed.

### 3. **About Section**
- Describes why users should choose the clinic.
- Includes an image alongside text content for better visual impact.

### 4. **Features Section**
- Highlights the clinic's specialties, such as professional surgeons and emergency care.
- Alternating layout with images and text for an engaging user experience.

### 5. **Services Section**
- Cards representing various services offered by the clinic, such as modern medicines and first medical aid.
- Icons for each service to enhance visual appeal.

### 6. **Gallery Section**
- A grid layout showcasing images of the clinic and its facilities.

### 7. **Testimonials Section**
- Displays user testimonials in a carousel format.
- Includes circular images of users with their feedback.

### 8. **Contact Section**

- Responsive design ensures the form looks good on all screen sizes.

### 9. **Footer**
- Contains contact details for two locations (New York and London).
- Includes a brief description and links to email and phone numbers.

## Technologies Used
### 1. **HTML5**
- Structure of the website is created using semantic HTML elements like `header`, `main`, `section`, and `footer`.

### 2. **CSS3**
- Custom styles are defined in the `style.css` file to complement Bootstrap's default styling.
- Variables are used for consistent color theming (e.g., `--mavi` for a blue shade).
- Specific styles for hover effects and responsive design are included.

### 3. **Bootstrap 5.3.3**
- Components such as the navbar, grid system, buttons, and carousels are implemented using Bootstrap.
- Provides responsiveness out of the box, ensuring the website adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes.

### 4. **Responsive Design**
- The `meta viewport` tag is included to enable mobile-friendly scaling.
- CSS media queries and Bootstrap's grid system (`col-12`, `col-md-4`, etc.) are used for layout adjustments.

### 5. **Images and Icons**
- High-quality images enhance the aesthetic appeal.
- Custom icons are used to represent different services.
- Hover effects are applied to specific images and sections for interactivity.
